Version 4.3.3 - 25 Mar 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release in over 4 years, however there have been only
a few actual bug fixes within the GAMMA code while the rest of the 
changes have been due to code syntax and make file issues for compiling
on newer versions of OSX, linux and Windows. A condensed listing of 
GAMMA changes is given at the end of this email, while a full listing
can always be found in our SVN log file.

PyGamma has undergone both a significant and long overdue update.

PyGamma installation files are now hosted at the Python Package Index (PyPI).
32- and 64-bit binaries for Windows, OS X, and Linux are available. 
Due to the prevalence of 64 bit platforms, version 4.3.3 is the last PyGamma 
for which we plan to provide 32-bit binaries. 

PyGamma is installable via pip, Python's preferred installer program.

In no particular order, the following changes have been made:

- Improved automation and error checking for make files and PyGamma builds
- added extern declarations for evolve and evolve_ip
- Changed the variable nil to nnil since this is now a predefined variable
  under OSX 10.9.2 and clang
- Added explicit braces for if/else to avoid warnings on OSX 10.9.
- Changed friend definitions for proj to make it compile under OSX 10.9. 
- Change handling of diagonal elements that are not fully real when building
  a Hermitian matrix. We output a warning and truncate the imaginary part of 
  the diagonal elements. Otherwise setting up exchange operators sometimes 
  can become a problem.
- Cleaned code syntax to eliminate compiler warnings.
- Replaced the SigmaSS routines with new ones from 
  balzan.riccardo@parisdescartes.fr which work independent of the basis the 
  operators are in. Seems to work better than the original ones that depended
  on the basis and only gave the correct steady-state density operator if 
  they were in the default Hilbert basis.
- Change std::_Ios_Openmode to std::ios_base::openmode which should be the 
  portable implementations. This makes BiIOBase compile under Mac OSX 10.10.
- Deleted the -isysroot which is as far as I can tell no longer needed on Mac.
  I did not change the minimum OS version but on 10.10 you should set this to
  10.9 or it will not compile. On my 10.9 Mac 10.6 still works.  
- submitted by Michael Tesch
  - fixed class name on renames, added python qualifier
  - fix probably bug in io, cleanup compiler warnings related to time_t, 
    which is a scalar
  - remove silly star (pointer reference) to stop compiler warning
- Corrected mistake when assigning initial value to time_t longtime in 
  XWinOutd.cc  Should be a long and not a pointer
- Changed wrong scaling of the A21 components of the spatial tensor in 
  IntRank2A.cc
- Bug reported by Riccardo Balzan: changed check for gcc version 3 and 4 to 
  also include version 5 and  newer such that it compiles also with updated 
  compilers.
- Big changes to how PyGamma is packaged and distributed.The main driver for 
  this is the goal of distributing PyGamma via wheel files rather than 
  tarballs/zip files that contain prebuilt binaries for all platforms.
- PyGamma no longer supports any Python versions other than 64-bit Python 2.7.



Version 4.3.2 - 27 Jan 2012
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no new features in this release. The only change is in the OS X 
build process. Under OS X, the PyGAMMA library no longer uses BLAS. This 
bypasses a problem where PyGAMMA crashsed when calling BLAS under OS X Lion 
(10.7) given certain conditions.


Version 4.3.1 - 29 August 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main feature of this release is the new pulseshift() function added
to PulAuxil. It's available to both GAMMA and PyGAMMA.

Additionally -- 

- In GenOp, completed SWIG-ing the functions of type /=, +=, etc. (so they 
return a "gen_op &"). This allows these functions to be accessed from PyGAMMA.

- Added real() and imag() functions to the GAMMA (PyGAMMA) class "complex"
to allow retrieval of the internal components from Python.



Version 4.3.0 - 5 July 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release features an expanded PyGAMMA which exposes most of GAMMA 
via Python. A full list of enhancements is below. Special thanks go to 
Matthias Ernst for all of his help with this release.

- Most of GAMMA is now available via Python. For a full list of what is and 
isn't available, see here:
http://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/wiki/SwiggedGammaListing

- BLAS/LAPACK integration is automatically enabled under OS X and Solaris and 
it's easy to enable for some Linuxes. See here for more information:
http://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/wiki/GammaWithBlasLapack

- We fixed a number of Makefile problems and made the Makefiles easier to 
maintain.

- We fixed the gamma script (on all platforms) for those of you that like to 
write and compile your own C++ GAMMA code.

- We cleaned all references to Boost (the old, unused Python interface) from 
the Makefiles and code.



Version 4.2.2 - 11 May 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release fixes the broken 32 bit Python 2.6 and 2.7 libraries for OS X
that were distributed with PyGAMMA 4.2.1.

It contains no other changes.



Version 4.2.1 - 10 May 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version is a small update to PyGAMMA's installation routine and prebuilt
libraries. It contains no functional changes to GAMMA or PyGAMMA.

- We changed the PyGAMMA ZIP file to not contain an empty directory which
some unzippers can't handle.

- We added prebuilt PyGAMMA binaries for Python 2.7 on OS X, Linux and 
Windows.



Version 4.2.0 - 10 Nov 2010
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first version of GAMMA to be released from the UCSF/Duke
collaboration.
